# Assessment-Mark-Storage-System-University-Assignment

University assignment from Foundation Year Computer Science. Tasked with creating an assessment mark storage system for a school in C.

This was my first ever programming assignment. I've come a long way since then, but I believe it demonstrates how I came to grasp the basic concepts of programming quickly.
